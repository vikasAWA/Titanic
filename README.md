# Titanic
Data anlysis and Predivtion on one of the most interesting kaggle dataset-

Introduction -

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Insights-
1) Female has good chance of survival overall but if take another factor Passenger Class with female, than female has more than 90% chance of survival in for First and Second Class while 50 % in Third Class

3) 2) Male does not not have good chance of survival, only for First Class it has about 63% chance of Survival
